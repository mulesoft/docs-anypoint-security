The Tokenization service enables you to substitute a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent.

Examples of sensitive information that are suitable for tokenization protection include:

* Primary Account Number (PAN)
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Protected Health Information (PHI), or any information deemed sensitive

Anypoint tokenization can create format-preserving tokens, which means the output tokens will have the same format as the sensitive data input. Format-preserving tokenization ensures that no changes are required to existing enterprise data flows or data stores, as the tokens generated conform to the existing data structure and validations. Changes to existing applications are minimized compared to point-to-point encryption, which requires data protection implementation at each "hop."
