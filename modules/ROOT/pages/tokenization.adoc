= Tokenization Service

The Tokenization service enables you to substitute a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent.

Examples of sensitive information that are suitable for tokenization protection include:

* Primary Account Number (PAN)
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Protected Health Information (PHI), or any information deemed sensitive

The Tokenization service provides the following benefits:

* *Vaultless operation*:
** Ensures sensitive data is not stored in the tokenization deployment.
** No data growth based on the number of transactions processed or tokens issued, thus removing data-vault management issues.
* *Increased security*:
** Protection of sensitive information reduces your sensitive data zones.
** Reduces or removes the number of systems and applications that process, store, or transmit sensitive information from sensitive data scopes.
** Negates the chances of a data breach from auxiliary applications and data stores, as the sensitive information stored in them is replaced by tokens.
** Increases defense in depth for sensitive data and least privilege. Authorization is required for the tokenization service to detokenize the sensitive data back to its actual value. Possession of the token alone provides no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.
* *Flexibility*:
** Ability to choose a tokenization strategy appropriate for your business using inbuilt data domains such as PAN, SSN, email, decimal, ascii and so on.
** Each domain has configurable options for preserving portions of the original sensitive data and replacing the rest with token data or replacing the entire information with a token.
** Operates seamlessly across wide area networks and distributed data centers.
* *Performance*:
** High-performance operation ensures low-latency processing.
** Performance scales linearly on each node with vertical and horizontal scaling for vaultless tokenization provided by the Anypoint Platform.

== Tokenization Service Use Cases

The way you configure and use the Tokenization service varies according to your implementation. For example:

* You can add the Tokenization service policy as one of the provided policies for the API Gateway. For more information, see xref:apply-tokenization-policy-to-api.adoc[Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway].
* When extra data processing is required, you can expose the Tokenization endpoint through a Mule app. For more information, see xref:tokenization-example.adoc[Use the Tokenization Service on the Edge].
