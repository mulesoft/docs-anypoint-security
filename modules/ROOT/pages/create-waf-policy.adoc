= Create a Web Application Firewall Policy

You can create a Web Application (WAF) policy in *Anypoint Security > Security Policies* to implement firewall security policy enforcement between your web application and client endpoint. WAF violation detection policies can also be escalated to Denial of Service (DoS) so that IPs and connections can be blocked.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and navigate to *Anypoint Security*.
. In the *Security Policies* page, click *Create Policy* and select *Web Application Firewall (WAF)*.
. Enter a *Name* for the policy and click *Save Policy*. +
The policy appears in the *Security Policies* list, where you can edit and delete policies.

== Configure Request Rulesets

Configure the rules to allow or block request traffic to your web application. For more information about request rulesets, see xref:waf-rulesets#request_rule_sets[Request rulesets].

. In the menu on the left, click *Request Rulesets*. +
All the rules are disabled by default. For each rule, you can: +
* *Disable ruleset* - (Default) Ruleset detection is turned off.
* *Detect and allow violations* - The violation is detected and you will get information, per incident, in your log at the `INFO` level.
* *Detect and reject violations* - The request is rejected and returns a response status of `HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST - web application firewall`, and DoS is notified that a rule was triggered. If xref:escalate-waf-to-dos.adoc[DoS has been configured for WAF Errors], DoS updates its WAF-related counters and takes action, if necessary. If DoS isn't configured for WAF Errors, it ignores the notification it receives from WAF. +
Information about the violation is also sent to the log, per incident, at `INFO` level.
+
When you hover over the `i` to the right of each rule, the rule ID range for that ruleset is displayed. You can use this information for testing rulesets.

+
. In *Advanced performance options*, select from the following options: +
* *Disable body scanner*. If you do not check this option, the request body is scanned.
+
[NOTE]
If a body is larger than 1 MB, the scan is skipped, even if you do not select *Disable body scanner*. If request body checking is enabled (default), the HTTP Limits policy *Maximum Message Size* should be set to a value no larger than required to prevent attackers from abusing request body checking, and exhausting resources.
* *Detect sensitive information* - You can select this option only if the *Disable body scanner* option is not selected. +
If you select this option, the request body is scanned for sensitive information, and when you apply the WAF policy to Runtime Fabric, the log summary (`rtfWafSecurityPolicySummary`) records the count and number (rule ID) of the sensitive information pattern that is detected. +
//An `rtfSidSummary` log is also generated, which contains the API, rule, direction, and count for instances of sensitive information.
. Click *Save Policy*.

== Configure Response Rulesets

Configure the rules to allow or block responses to your web application. For more information about response rulesets, see xref:waf-rulesets#response_rule_sets[Response rulesets]

. In the menu on the left, click *Response Rulesets*. +
All the rulesets are disabled by default. For each rule, you can: +
* *Disable ruleset* - (Default) Ruleset detection is turned off.
* *Detect and allow violations* - The violation is detected and you will get information, per incident, in your log at the `INFO` level.
* *Detect and reject violations* - The request is rejected and returns a response status of `HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST - web application firewall` and information about the violation is also sent to the log at INFO level per incident.
. In *Advanced Performance Options*, select from the following options: +
* *Disable body scanner* - This option works the same as it does for the request ruleset, however, there are some additional important caveats:
+
[IMPORTANT]
If a body is larger than 1 MB, the body scan is skipped, even if you selected *Disable body scanner*. 
+
* For resource usage management, a maximum response size of 512 KB is imposed and is not configurable. If response rulesets are enabled with the *Disable body scanner* unchecked, a response with a content-length greater than 512 KB are rejected.
* Response messages must have one of the following MIME types in the content type header, or the WAF rules will not be evaluated:
** text/plain
** text/html
** text/xml
** application/json
+
* *Detect sensitive information* - You can select this option only if the *Disable body scanner* option is not selected. +
If you select this option, the response body is scanned for sensitive information, and when you apply the WAF policy to Runtime Fabric, the log summary (`rtfWafSecurityPolicySummary`) records the count and number (rule ID) of the sensitive information pattern that is detected. +
//An `rtfSidSummary` log is also generated, which contains the API, rule, direction, and count for instances of sensitive information.
. Click *Save Policy*.

== Disable Individual Rules

If individual rules cause false positives, you can disable them. This is useful because if only one rule in the ruleset is causing a false positive, it isn't necessary to turn off an entire ruleset such as â€œProtocol attack."

You can examine the WAF summary message in logs to determine which rule IDs are firing. You can also check the Anypoint Security policy's RAML for a complete list of rule IDs.

. In the *Anypoint Security > Security Policies* page, click *Edit* for the WAF policy to disable rules.
. In the menu on the left, click *Disabled Rule IDs*.
. Add the individual rule IDs for the rules to disable, separated by commas.
. Click *Save Policy*.

Once your WAF policy is configured and saved, you can (optionally) edit an existing DoS policy to enable DoS for your WAF policy, then deploy the policies to Runtime Fabric.
