= Secret Groups

A secret group is a unique secrets vault to which all your secrets are bound. Secrets Manager stores your secrets per secret group, per environment, and per business group.

User access and authorization controls are applied at the environment level. A user who has access on a given environment can access all the secret groups that belong to that environment. Only applications deployed to those specific business groups and environments within your organization can access the secrets stored in each secret group.
