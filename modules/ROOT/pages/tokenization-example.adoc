= Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications

For some use cases, for example, if a lot of complex data processing needs to take place before traffic gets to the tokenization/de-tokenization service, it makes sense to set up a Mule app to which Edge can route the traffic. In this scenario, the Mule app allows the flexibility to process the data and then send the traffic to the Tokenization service. 

The Mule application can also do nothing other than expose the Tokenization service as a pass-through. 

[NOTE]
Because the Tokenization service only accepts TLS traffic, you must configure TLS for the Mule app and enable the LastMile security. 

== Prerequisites

To configure the tokenization service, you need the following:

* Runtime Fabric 1.1.153 or later with inbound traffic configured. See xref:1.2@runtime-fabric::index.adoc[the Runtime Fabric documentation].
* A secret group to store the tokenization table encryption keys. The tokenization service creates and stores its own keys. See xref:asm-secret-group-concept.adoc[Secrets Manager documentation].
* A tokenization format, which describes the format and how data is tokenized. See xref:tokenization-formats.adoc[Tokenization Formats].
* A tokenization service that handles the actual tokenization requests and also tokenizes and detokenizes the data. For security purposes, an API Gateway must protect this service.
* API Gateway, which proxies requests to the tokenization service, provides authorization and authentication, and provides JSON protection for the tokenization service.


image::tokenization-setup-example-diagram.png[Tokenization Examples]

In this diagram, a separate zone segregates the tokenization service from the general Runtime Fabric. This segregation is based on security needs.

For example, if sensitive data is produced from a Mule app serving external traffic (Client -> Edge -> Mule application), this app might be included in the sensitive data zone.

== Runtime Fabric 1.1.153 or Later with Inbound Traffic

This example shows a Runtime Fabric named "rtf231", which has inbound traffic that is using a certificate and private key in the secret group “alphatoken”. If you already have a Runtime Fabric and secret group configured, use those names in places of the ones in the example.

=== What to Know About Secret Groups and Tokenization

Each Tokenization service you create must have a corresponding, dedicated secret group in Secrets Manager. No other Tokenization service should use this secret group and no secrets outside of this Tokenization service should be stored in that secret group.

Use Secrets Manager xref:asm-secret-group-creation-task.adoc[to create and manage secret groups]. 

When you delete a Tokenization service, you can delete the corresponding secret group.

This is the recommended approach for several reasons:

. Using a dedicated secret group for the tokenization service helps avoid other secret groups from being deleted accidentally when you delete a secret group. 
. You can create as many formats as needed and change the set of formats assigned to the tokenization service, and the secret group will never be exhausted.
. This unique association between the tokenization service and its dedicated secret group prevents running out of the secrets of the VDP Context type in a secret group. In the worst case, there will be 10 secrets created of the VDP Context type--one for each VDP domain.

Normally, you can view, edit, or create secrets in Secrets Manager. However, the tokenization table keys are a non-editable part of the secret group. You can see the tokenization secrets under shared secrets, but you are not allowed to modify them. Actions such as edit, cancel edit, and finish do not apply.

Click *View* to see the name, type, and expiration of the secret group.

For more information about secret groups, see xref:asm-secret-group-concept.adoc[Secrets Manager documentation].

== Set up the API Gateway

. xref:tokenization-formats.adoc[Create the tokenization format] to define the way incoming data is converted.  
. xref:create-tokenization-service.adoc[Create the Tokenization service]. +

[NOTE]
You must download the automatically generated API Gateway Mule application and manually add TLS to the API Gateway Mule application connectors before you can make this service work. Tokenization involves sensitive data, and therefore, works only with TLS. +
Once you create the tokenization service, you need to create an API Gateway to route requests to the tokenization service.
. In API Manager, xref:2.x@api-manager::getting-started-proxy.adoc[set up the API gateway] for the Mule app to serve as the proxy. 
.. Go to the *Tokenization Service* page in Runtime Manager to get the information you need for the implementation URL.
.. In Runtime Manager, click *Tokenization Service* in the menu on the left.
. Click *Edit* for the tokenization service for which to create the API Gateway.
+
image::tokenization-example-edit-token-service.png[]
.. Confirm the Runtime Fabric assignment. +
+
The Tokenization service listens on port 3443 and is available through HTTPS only. The hostname portion is formed by taking the “Service Name” + “tokenizer” to arrive at the service name. For example, if the Tokenization service name is “mytoken1” the implementation URL will be: “https://mytoken1­tokenizer:3443”. 
 
== Create an API from the Tokenization RAML

Once you have the information you need to set up a routable tokenization service using an Api Gateway, create an API from the tokenization RAML.

. In Anypoint Platform, go to Exchange, and search for "Tokenization Service API."
. Download the `AMC Tokenizer.zip` file.
. Go to *Design Center* and select *Create > API Specification*. For this example, the API specification is named "AMC Tokenizer". If you choose a different name, use that one in the below steps.
+
image::tokenization-example-create-api-spec.png[]
. Next to *File*, select *Import* and upload the `AMC Tokenizer.zip` file you downloaded from Exchange in Step 1.
+
image::tokenization-example-upload-amc-tokenizer.png[]
. Publish the asset to Anypoint Exchange.
. Navigate to *API Manager* from the top level Anypoint Platform menu.
. Select *Manage API > Manage API from Exchange*.
+
image::tokenization-example-manage-api-from-exchange.png[]
. Enter the API configuration information, and click *Save*. The following image shows example values.
+
image::tokenization-example-api-configuration.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Do not use *Advanced* options, as HTTPS is not supported on Runtime Fabric.
 .. Go to the *Deployment Configuration*, select your Runtime Fabric and Mule version, then enter a name for the API Gateway. The following example shows information for an API Gateway named "token2mule".
+
image::tokenization-example-deploy-config.png[]
. Click *Deploy*. The button changes to *Redeploy* after the first deployment finishes. This deploys the API Gateway application.
. Download the API Gateway application to configure SSL within it:
.. In API Manager, go to the *Settings* page for your API.
.. Select *Actions > Download Proxy*.
+
image::tokenization-example-download-proxy.png[]
+
[NOTE]
This last step is necessary to configure TLS.

== Configure TLS

. Go to Anypoint Studio, and import the API Gateway.
+
image::tokenization-example-import-api-gateway-studio.png[]
. Go to `src/main/resources` and add the keystore. In this example the keystore is named `tester.jks`.
+
image::tokenization-example-keystore.png[]
. Add TLS to the listener side so you can later enable the *Last Mile Security* flag. To do this, first set the HTTPS flag.
+
image::tokenization-example-set-https-flag.png[]
. Set the keystore information. In this example the trust store side is set to *insecure* and the keystore, alias, and password information has been added.
+
image::tokenization-example-set-keystore-info.png[]
. Now set the HTTPS on the *Server* tab, then configure your keystore on the TLS side to configure the client side.
+
image::tokenization-example-configure-TLS.png[]
. Save the application and export it. Remember where it is saved so you can upload it in the next step.

== Add the TLS Enabled API Gateway

. In Anypoint Platform, go to the *Runtime Manager* page and click on the name of the API Gateway application `token2mule`.
. In the *Settings* page, select *Choose File ­> Upload File* to upload the API Gateway application you modified in Anypoint Studio.
. Select the *Enable Last­Mile Security* option. Your settings should look similar to this image.
+
image::tokenization-example-add-tls-enabled-gateway.png[]
. Click *Deploy*. +
Once the application has a status of "Running" you are ready to test.

//// 
== Test the Tokenization Traffic

Once the application is running, you are ready to send traffic. To fully secure the service, it is a good idea to test the service before you complete the additional steps. You can use POSTMAN or `curl` to test the service.

An example `curl` command is provided below. Replace the IP address with your own IP address. If you have used names that are different from the example for format, tokenization service, or API name, modify the `curl` command accordingly.

To try tokenizing data, send the following `curl` command:

----
curl ­-k ­­--resolve token2mule.ic.example.com:443:192.168.2.1 https://token2mule.ic.example.com/tb/v1/tokenization -­X POST -­H "Content­type: application/json" ­­--data '[{"data": "683­31­8102", "format": "ssndemo"}]
----

You should get a response similar to the following:

`HTTP/1.1 200 OK [{"data":"597­74­8102","status":"success"}]`
//// 

== Add Authorization and JSON Threat Protection

The tokenization service has no authentication or authorization. The only way to protect it is to allow access only through an Api Gateway with some type of authorization policy enabled.

This example shows you how to add a basic authorization policy to provide simple authentication.

. Go to the API Manager page where you created the API Gateway.
. In the menu on the left, click *Policies*.
. Create a *Simple security manager* and add a simple username and password.
+
image::tokenization-example-apply-simple-security.png[]
. Click *Apply New Policy* and add the “HTTP Basic Authorization” policy.
. Add the JSON threat protection policy.
+
[NOTE]
A maximum of 100 tokenization or detokenization items can be included in each tokenization or detokenization request.
+
The following image shows an example.
+
image::tokenization-example-json-threat-protection.png[]
+
The *Policies* page should look similar to the following example.
+
image::tokenization-example-policies-page.png[]

//// 
== Test Runtime Traffic with Basic Authorization

Run the following `curl` command to send traffic with the `--user` flag for basic authorization.

----
curl ­-k --­­resolve token2mule.ic.example.com:443:192.168.2.1 https://token2mule.ic.example.com/tb/v1/tokenization -­X POST ­-H "Content­type: application/json" ­­data '[{"data": "683­31­8102", "format": "ssndemo"}]' ­-k ­­--user test:test
----

You should receive a response similar to the following:

`HTTP/1.1 200 OK [{"data":"597­74­8102","status":"success"}]`

You can take the tokenized SSN from above and send it back to the service. The original SSN will be returned. Remember that the token returned always preserves the format of the input data.

----
curl ­-k ­­--resolve token2mule.ic.example.com:443:192.168.2.1 https://token2mule.ic.example.com/tb/v1/detokenization ­-X POST ­-H "Content­type: application/json" ­­data '[{"data": "597­74­8102", "format": "ssndemo"}]' ­-k ­­--user test:test
----

You should receive a response similar to the following:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK [{"data":"683­31­8102","status":"success"}][root@openstackvm32 pentest­ca]
----

The following is an example of bad tokenization:

----
curl ­v ­-k ­­--resolve token2mule.ic.example.com:443:192.168.2.1 https://token2mule.ic.example.com/tb/v1/tokenization -­X POST ­-H "Content­type: application/json" ­­data '[{"data": "597­74­8102­­­­­­­­sdsdsdsdsdsdsdsds", "format": "ssndemo"}]' ­-k ­­--user test:test
----

You should receive a response similar to the following:

----
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
[{"data":"","status":"failure","errorcode":1384,"error":"The social security number is invalid.
It contains [26] characters.
A social security number must have the format ###-##-#### where # represents a decimal digit."}]
----

The following is an example of bad detokenization:

----
curl ­v ­-k ­­--resolve token2mule.ic.example.com:443:192.168.2.1 https://token2mule.ic.example.com/tb/v1/detokenization ­-X POST ­-H "Content­type: application/json" ­­data '[{"data": "597­74­8102­­­­­­­­sdsdsdsdsdsdsdsds", "format": "ssndemo"}]' ­-k ­­--user test:test
----

You should receive a response similar to the following:

----
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
[{"data":"","status":"failure","errorcode":1380,"error":"The social security number is invalid.
It contains [26] characters.
