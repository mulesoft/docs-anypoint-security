The way you configure and use the tokenization service depends on your Mule implementation. 

== Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway

You can apply a tokenization policy to the API gateway capability of Mule 4 to serve as the intermediary between Anypoint Security's edge and the Mule app. 

See xref:apply-tokenization-policy-to-api.adoc[Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway]
 

== Expose Tokenization as a Service to Mule Apps

When extra data processing is required, you can configure the tokenization service so that the Mule app processes the data and send the traffic to the tokenization service. 

See xref:tokenization-from-a-mule.adoc[Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications]
