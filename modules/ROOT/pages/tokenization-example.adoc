The way you configure and use the tokenization service depends on your Mule implementation. 

== Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway

You can apply a tokenization policy to configure the API gateway capability of Mule 4 to tokenize or detokenize request and response data sent between the Anypoint Runtime Fabric inbound load balancer and the Mule app. 

See xref:apply-tokenization-policy-to-api.adoc[Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway]
 

== Expose Tokenization as a Service to Mule Apps

When extra data processing is required, a Mule application can add business logic to send tokenization and detokenization requests directly to the tokenization service as part of its processing. 

See xref:tokenization-from-a-mule.adoc[Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications]
