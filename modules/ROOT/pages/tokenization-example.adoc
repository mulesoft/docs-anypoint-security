= Tokenization Service Configurations
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

The way you configure and use the tokenization service depends on your Mule implementation:

* <<tokenize_api_policy,The API gateway>> capability of Mule 4 with a tokenization policy applied.
* <<tokenize_mule_app,A Mule runtime engine with a Mule app>> that calls the tokenization service.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To configure and use the tokenization service, you must:

. Have these permissions: 
 ** API Manager *Manage Policies*
 ** Tokenization *Manage Tokenization Services* 
+ 
See xref:2.x@api-manager::environment-permission-task.adoc[Granting Permission to Access an Environment]
. xref:runtime-fabric::install-create-rtf-arm.adoc[Install Runtime Fabric]. Anypoint Runtime Fabric is a container service that automates the deployment and orchestration of Mule applications and API gateways.
. To allow Mule applications or API gateways to listen on inbound connections, enable inbound traffic, you must xref:runtime-fabric::enable-inbound-traffic.adoc[Enable inbound traffic] on Runtime Fabric.


[[tokenize_api_policy]]
== Configure Tokenization Using Policies

You can configure the API Gateway and use the tokenization service as the core engine for the tokenization and detokenization policies provided in API Manager. 

To use tokenizatin and detokenization policies to configure the tokenization service:

. Ensure you have completed the <<prerequisites,required prerequisites>>. 
. xref:create-tokenization-format.adoc[Create a tokenization format].
. xref:create-tokenization-service.adoc[Create a tokenization service].
. In API Manager, xref:2.x@api-manager::getting-started-proxy.adoc[set up the API gateway] for the Mule app to serve as the proxy. 
. Apply xref:2.x@api-manager::policy-mule4-tokenization.adoc[the tokenization policy] to the API gateway.

For more information, see xref:apply-tokenization-policy-to-api.adoc[Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway].

[[tokenize_mule_app]]
== Configure Tokenization Using a Mule App

When extra data processing is required, you can expose the tokenization endpoint through a Mule app. 

To use a Mule app to expose the tokenization endpoint:

. Ensure you have completed the <<prerequisites,required prerequisites>>. 
. xref:create-tokenization-format.adoc[Create a tokenization format].
. xref:create-tokenization-service.adoc[Create a tokenization service].
. Configure TLS. See xref:tokenization-from-a-mule.adoc#configure_tls[Configure TLS]
. xref:tokenization-from-a-mule.adoc#create_an_api_from_the_tokenization_raml[Create an API from the tokenization RAML].
. Deploy the app to Runtime Fabric. See xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-index.adoc[Deploy Applications and API Proxies to Runtime Fabric].

For more information, see xref:tokenization-example.adoc[Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications].
