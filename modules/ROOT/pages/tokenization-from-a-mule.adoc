= Expose Tokenization as a Service Directly to Mule Applications
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

In some cases, for example, if a lot of complex data processing needs to take place before traffic gets to the tokenization/de-tokenization service, it makes sense to set up a Mule app to which Edge can route the traffic. In this scenario, the Mule app allows the flexibility to process the data and then send the traffic to the tokenization service. 

The Mule app can also do nothing other than expose the tokenization service as a pass-through. 

[NOTE]
Because the tokenization service accepts only TLS traffic, you must enable TLS for the Mule HTTP outbound, and enable Las-tMile security when deploying the Mule app to Runtime Fabric so the edge-to-Mule-app connection uses TLS.

[tokenization_raml]
== Create an API from the Tokenization RAML

Once you have the information you need to set up a routable tokenization service using an API Gateway, create an API from the tokenization RAML.

. Go to the public https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[Anypoint Platform developer portal], and search for "Tokenization API."
. Select *Download > As RAML*. The RAML is downloaded as a ZIP file.
. Go to your Exchange portal, and click *New asset*. 
. Set the *Name* as `Tokenization API` and the *Type* as `REST API - RAML`.
. Select the ZIP file you downloaded, and click *Publish*.
. In Studio or Design Center, create an HTTP outbound connection based on the `Tokenization API` RAML. +
The tokenization service in Runtime Fabric listens on port 3443 and is available through HTTPS only. +
The hostname portion for the outbound URL is formed by taking the service name + `-tokenizer`. For example, if the Tokenization service name is “mytoken1”, the outbound URL will be: `https://mytoken1-­tokenizer:3443`.
. Before the HTTP outbound, use a Datawave transform step to convert your input data into the `TokenizationServiceRequest` data type defined in the `Tokenization API` RAML. +
The request is an array of items, and a single example is: `{"format" : "ssnonly", "data" : "333-33-3333"}`.
The value of `format` matches a tokenization format that is defined on the service.  The `data` value is what to tokenize or detokenize. +
[NOTE]
The `array` should be 100 items long at most. If it is any longer than 100 items, break it up into multiple requests to the tokenization service.
. Set the HTTP Listener in the Mule application to HTTPS. See <<Configure TLS>>. 
. Export the Mule app.
. In Runtime Manager, xref:1.2@runtime-fabric::deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[deploy the application to Runtime Fabric]. +
[NOTE]
You must select the *Last mile security* checkbox to enable TLS between the edge and the Mule app.
. (Optional) For improved security and protection of the Mule app, you should add some method of authentication.


[configure_TLS]
== Configure TLS

This is an example of how to configure TLS for Mule apps in Studio 7.3.

. Go to Anypoint Studio, and open the project for your Mule app.
+
image::tokenization-example-import-api-gateway-studio.png[]
. Go to `src/main/resources` and add the keystore. In this example the keystore is named `tester.jks`.
+
image::tokenization-example-keystore.png[]
. Add TLS to the listener side so you can later enable the *Last Mile Security* flag. To do this, first set the HTTPS flag.
+
image::tokenization-example-set-https-flag.png[]
. Click the *TLS* tab to set the keystore information, then select the following: +
 * From the *TLS Configuration* drop-down, select *Edit inline*. 
 * In *Trust Store Configuration*, check the *Insecure* box.
 * In *Key Store Configuration*, enter the information for your keystore, and click *OK*. +
 In this example the trust store side is set to *insecure* and the keystore, alias, and password information has been added.
+

. Edit the settings for the HTTP endpoint to enable TLS on the HTTP connection from Mule to the tokenization service. 
+
image::tokenization-example-configure-TLS.png[]
. Save the application and export it. 
. In Anypoint Platform, go to *Runtime Manager*, and click *Deploy Application*. 
. In the *Deploy Application* page:
.. Enter an *Application Name*.
.. From the *Deployment Target* drop-down, select the Runtime Fabric to which to deploy the app.
.. Click *Choose file* to upload the application you exported. 
.. Select the *Runtime version* for the Mule the app will run on, and configure your *Replicas* and *Resource Allocation*.
.. Click the *Ingress* tab, and select *Enable Last­Mile Security* option.
. Click *Deploy Application*.
