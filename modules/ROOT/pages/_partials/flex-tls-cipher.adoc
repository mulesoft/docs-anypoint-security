== Select Ciphers

When you configure a TLS context, Secrets Manager applies default ciphers based on the TLS versions you select. In addition to the defaults, you can select other ciphers to use with the selected TLS version. Each TLS context can have multiple ciphers.

To select ciphers:

. Click *Ciphers* to see available ciphers. 
. Select ciphers.
+
If you select a *TLS Version* value of *TLS 1.3*, the default selection is not customizable.
. Click *Save*

== TLS Support on Flex Gateway

Flex can support a range of TLS Versions from TLS 1.1 to TLS 1.3, and you can also customize some of the ciphers to support.

You cannot customize the list of TLS 1.3 Ciphers. If you support TLS 1.3, you must support the TLS 1.3 default ciphers.

If you support TLS 1.2, the TLS 1.2 default Ciphers are selected. However, unlike TLS 1.3, you can customize different TLS 1.2 ciphers.

There are no default ciphers for TLS 1.1. If you choose to support TLS 1.1, you must select the ciphers you want to support.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that your API upstream supports the selected ciphers and versions.
