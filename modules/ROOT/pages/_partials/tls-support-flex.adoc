== TLS Support on Flex Gateway

//end::intro1[]

The TLS 1.3 protocol is enabled by default for those clients that support it.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 provide the following security enhancements and performance improvements over TLS 1.2:

* Double or more than double TLS 1.2 connection performance throughput boost over an earlier Runtime Fabric internal load balancer running on OpenSSL 1.0.2
* Reduction of one round trip in a full handshake
* Added TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphers for better mobile and IoT device support
* Protection against downgrade attacks
* Continued support for both RSA and ECDSA keys
* Removal of obsolete and insecure features from TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.1. +
See xref:release-notes::anypoint-security/anypoint-security-rtf-edge.adoc[Anypoint Security Edge Release Notes] for a list of supported and deprecated ciphers.
