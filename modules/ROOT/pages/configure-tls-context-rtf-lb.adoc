= Configure a TLS Context for Anypoint Runtime Fabric
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

All inbound traffic entering Anypoint Runtime Fabric is encrypted using TLS. When enabling inbound traffic, you must provide a valid TLS certificate. When you configure inbound traffic for Runtime Fabric, you can configure the TLS server by importing a Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) or Java Keystore (JKS) file, or by importing a TLS context from the secrets manager (advanced use case).

Before you can import the TLS Context from the secrets manager, you must add the TLS context. 

== Add the TLS Context to a Secret Group

Adding a TLS context to your secret group involves supplying a name, target, security information, version, keystore and, optionally, truststore. 

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to which you want to add a TLS context. 
. Select *TLS Context* in the menu on the left, and click *Add TLS Context*. 
. In the Create TLS Context screen, add the required information:
+
* *Name* +
Enter a name for your TLS context. 
* *Target* +
Select *Anypoint Security* to validate the SSL handshake for Runtime Fabric. 
* *TLS Version* +
By default, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are selected. +
For information about the advantages of TLS 1.3, see xref:asm-secret-type-support-reference.adoc[Supported Secret Types].
* *Keystore* +
From the drop-down list, select the keystore to store the TLS context. +
For information about adding a keystore to the secrets manager see xref:asm-secret-group-creation-task#add_keystore.adoc[Create a Secret Group]. +
You can select keystores that are either PEM or non-PEM types. 
* Optionally select a truststore to which to add the TLS context if you are using a truststore to store certificates trusted by the client. +
A trust store is required if you are going to enable client authentication.
* *Expiration Date* +
Optionally select the expiration date for the certificate.
. Optionally xref:enable-client-authentication.adoc[enable client authentication]. 
. Optionally xref:cipher-suites.adoc[select ciphers]. 
. Click *Save*.

== Import a TLS Context to Runtime Fabric

. In *Runtime Manager > Runtime Fabrics > Inbound Traffic*, select one of the following options: +
* *Upload PEM* +
For information about this option, see xref:runtime-fabric::enable-inbound-traffic.adoc[Enable Inbound Traffic on Anypoint Runtime Fabric]
* *Upload JKS* +
For information about this option, see xref:runtime-fabric::enable-inbound-traffic.adoc[Enable Inbound Traffic on Anypoint Runtime Fabric]
* *Import from Secrets Manager*. +
This option is automatically selected for Runtime Fabrics for which inbound traffic was enabled before the PEM and JKS upload options became available. +
This option imports a TLS context from the secrets manager, and supports advanced configuration such as creating a TLS context, mutual authentication, selecting ciphers, and selecting TLS versions.
. Select the environment the secret group that contains the TLS context is associated with.
. Select the secret group where the TLS context is configured.
. Select the TLS context to use for Runtime Fabric. +
You can click *View Details* to see details of the TLS context you are importing.
