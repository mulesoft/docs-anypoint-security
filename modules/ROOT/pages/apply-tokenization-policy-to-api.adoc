= Apply a Tokenization Policy to the API Gateway

In this scenario, you apply the tokenization policy to the API gateway, which serves as the intermediary between the Edge and the Mule application. The tokenization service in this case is implicit and made available through internal integration with the API gateway. 

== Prerequisites

To apply a tokenization policy to the API Gateway, you must meet these requirements:

* You must have the following Anypoint permissions:
 ** Manage Policies
* The API must be managed in Mule 4 or later

== Apply a Tokenization Policy to an API Gateway

When the tokenization service is applied directly to the API gateway, you don't need to use the tokenization RAML to expose the Tokenization service. You only need to set up the API gateway for the Mule app to serve as the proxy.

These are the high level steps:

. xref:1.2@runtime-fabric::install-create-rtf-arm.adoc[Install Runtime Fabric].
. xref:1.2@runtime-fabric::enable-inbound-traffic.adoc[Enable inbound traffic] on Runtime Fabric
. xref:tokenization-formats.adoc[Create a tokenization format].
. xref:create-tokenization-service.adoc[Create a Tokenization service].
. In API Manager, xref:2.x@api-manager::getting-started-proxy.adoc[set up the API gateway] for the Mule app to serve as the proxy.
. Click *Apply New Policy* and select the Tokenization service policy to apply. +
Available Tokenization service policies appear in *Policies > Tokenization*.

You can now use the Tokenization service to tokenize and de-tokenize request and response payloads.
