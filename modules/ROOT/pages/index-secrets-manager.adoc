Secrets Manager uses secure vault technology to store and control access to private keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.

Use Secrets Manager to write and manage your secrets, keys, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) artifacts. You can read the metadata of the secrets, but the actual secrets can be consumed only by authorized platform services on your behalf.

Secrets Manager is designed to store and manage secrets for supported Anypoint platform services. It is not a general-purpose storage for secrets. Only trusted services within Anypoint Platform have access to the contents of the secret. 


Secrets Manager supports the management of TLS context for the following services:

* Runtime Fabric ingress +
You can store TLS artifacts in Secrets Manager and then configure the Runtime Fabric ingress with the secret reference.
* API Manager in CloudHub +
You can store the TLS artifacts in Secrets Manager and then configure the API Manager with the secret reference.

The Anypoint platformâ€™s Secrets Manager lets you store secrets in secret groups, which are vaults associated with your environment and business group. Each secret group has unique encryption keys, which are generated and managed only by Secrets Manager. 

You can configure the supported Anypoint Platform services to request secrets stored in Secrets Manager, and you can control which supported services are authorized to access them. This task is handled by two microservices:

* Secrets Manager +
This is a publicly exposed service which handles the uploading and storing of your secrets.
Every time you upload a secret to your vault, the Secrets Manager establishes a reference to it, so it can be shared or read without revealing its contents. You can read the metadata the secrets uploaded but not the real content. 
* Secrets Provider +
This is an internal service which handles the secrets for consumption by supported platform services.
This is the only service that can read the actual secrets, and due to its nature, it is not accessible from the public network.

== Supported Secret Types

Secrets Manager can store and manage the following secret types:

* TLS Context: +
SSL Security Parameters (ciphers to use, TLS version, and so on).
* Keystore: +
A repository of security certificates (either authorization certificates or public key certificates) along with their corresponding private keys.
* Truststore: +
A repository of security certificates from other parties with which you expect to communicate, or from Certificate Authorities that you trust to identify other parties.
* Certificates:. +
Public X.509 certificates, electronic documents that bind together a public key with an identity (hostname, organization, or individual).
* Certificate Pin Set: +
A repository of security certificates from other parties that associate a client or host with their expected X.509 certificate or public key.
* CRL Distributor: +
An entity that creates and maintains a list of CA certificates that are no longer trusted because their associated private keys, or a signing CA, were compromised.


//// 
* Shared Secrets: +
Shared secrets are used for symmetric encryption and decryption, where the secret is known by both the message sender and the message recipient. +
Anypoint Secrets Manager lets you store the following secret types to use as shared secrets.
** Passwords: +
A password used by the sender and recipient to encode and decode the message.
** Symmetric Keys: +
A public key cryptography used by the sender and recipient to encode and decode the message.
** S3 Credentials: +
A pair of security keys to access AWS S3 buckets.
** Blob: +
A free-form and application-specific secret. Blobs are base64 encoded data used by specific applications. For example, a blob could store a base64-encoded JSON object. +
The secret is stored through an API call and must be base64 encoded.
* Private Keys: +
A secret key value paired with a public key to set off algorithms for encryption and decryption.
