In the Runtime Fabric *Inbound Traffic > Security Policies* interface, you can unblock IP addresses and generate a list of blocked IP addresses, which you can view in Runtime Fabric logs. 

[NOTE]
You must have a DoS policy configured to manage IP addresses in Runtime Fabric. See xref:dos-policy.adoc[Denial of Service Policy]

. In Anypoint Platform go to *Management Center > Runtime Manager*.
. In the left navigation menu, click *Runtime Fabrics*.  
. Select the Runtime Fabric for which to manage the blocked IP addresses. 
. Select the *Inbound Traffic* tab. 
. In the *Security Policies* section, click *Manage blocked IPs*.
. In the *Manage blocked IPs* dialog box, you can download a list of blocked IP addresses into a log file or unblock IP addresses. 

== Unblock Blocked IP Addresses

. To unblock IP addresses, enter the IP addresses to unblock in the field, then click *Unblock IPs*. +
. In the *Unblock an IP Address* field, enter an individual or a range of IP addresses. +
For example, to unblock a range of IP addresses, enter: `192.0.2.0â€“192.0.2.255` +
When the IP addresses are successfully unblocked, an `Unblocked` message displays.

== Log Blocked IP Addresses

. To generate a list of blocked IP addresses, click *Log blocked IPs*. +
When the blocked IP addresses are successfully logged, a `Logged` message appears. 
. To view the logs, follow the instructions in the xref:1.2@runtime-fabric::runtime-fabric-logs.adoc[View and Configure Logging] for configuring log forwarding. +
