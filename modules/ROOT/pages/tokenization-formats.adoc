= Tokenization Formats

Tokenization formats define how the original format of data coming in is converted to the format you configure when the token is created.  For example, you can define whether to preserve certain digits, if the token should look like the original data source, or whether to tokenize the whole or partial string.

When you xref:create-tokenization-format.adoc[create a tokenization format] and select the data domain, you are given <<data_domain_config_options,configuration options>>. 

== Supported Data Domains

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|*Data Domain* |*Description*
|*Credit card number*
|Decimal number with special restrictions on length. Luhn checksum with limited set of lax character allowed; preserve first and last "n" digits; force invalid.

|*Decimal* 
|Arbitrary length decimal number; preserve first and last "n" digits; force invalid.

|*Lax decimal* 
|Arbitrary length decimal number with lax characters allowed; preserve first and last "n" digits; force invalid.

//|Phone number 
//|Use Lax decimal format to tokenize this type of data.
//
//Only exists to simplify an Application Architect mapping to the desired data domain semantics. A phone number may be encoded with up to four lax characters depending on national conventions, for example, in the U.S. (XXX) XXX­ XXXX while in Europe the format is XXX.XXX.XXXX.

| *Social security number*
|Nine­ digit decimal number with special sub­component restrictions; a limited number of lax characters (non­-decimal digits) are allowed. Preserve serial number component; force invalid.

| *Email address* 
|Complex domain with separate restrictions for local­ part (Radix = 83) and domain (Radix = 64) components.

|*Printable ASCII* 
|Subset of the UTF­8 characters between unicode number (int) 32 through 126 (A­Za­ z0­9, space, double quote) and the following special characters: ! # $ % & '( ) * + ,­ . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] &#94; _ &#96; { } &#126; Normal keyboard characters are allowed (called Printable ASCII in tokenization). Preserve first and last "n" characters.

|*Lax alphanumeric* 
|Uppercase Latin, lowercase Latin, and decimal characters obfuscated but with lax characters allowed; preserve first and last "n" characters.

|*Lax uppercase/lowercase/decimal - Preserving* 
|Uppercase Latin characters in the clear­text will remain uppercase Latin characters in the obfuscated­ text. Lowercase Latin characters in the clear­text will remain lowercase Latin in the obfuscated­ text. Decimal digits in the clear­text will remain decimal digits in the obfuscated­ text. All other characters will be handled as lax characters. Preserve first and last "n" characters.

|*Lax uppercase/decimal - Preserving* 
|Uppercase Latin characters in the clear­text will remain uppercase Latin characters in the obfuscated­ text. Decimal digits in the clear­text will remain decimal digits in the obfuscated­ text. All other characters will be handled as lax characters. Preserve first and last "n" characters.

|*Lax lowercase/decimal - Preserving* 
|Lowercase Latin characters in the clear­text remain lowercase Latin in the obfuscated­ text. Decimal digits in the clear­text remain decimal digits in the obfuscated­ text. All other characters are handled as lax characters. Preserve first and last "n" characters.

|Option |Description |Data Domain

|*Preserve first characters* 
| Defines the number of characters from the original string to NOT tokenize. Enter a value for the number of beginning digits to preserve. For example, `4`.
a| * Credit card
* Decimal
* Lax decimal
* Lax alphanumeric
* Printable ASCII
* Lax uppercase/lowercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax uppercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax lowercase/decimal - Preserving

|*Preserve last characters*
|Enter a value for the number of last digits to preserve. For example, `4`. +
Using the example values of `4` for first and last respectively, means that the first four digits and last four digits of the original string are preserved, and everything in between will be tokenized.
a| * Credit card number
* Decimal
* Lax decimal
* Lax alphanumeric
* Printable ASCII
* Lax uppercase/lowercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax uppercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax lowercase/decimal - Preserving

|*Force token characters in illegal range* 
a|For example, if you have the CCN 1234567890123456 and you set the *Preserve characters* option to preserve the last four digits and force an invalid one digit with an offset of two from left. The generated token would look similar to: 54D3210987653456.

A decimal digit will be mapped into the Latin alphabet character range.

[NOTE]
You are limited to two illegal characters because you really need only one to make the data invalid (such as adding a letter A to a social security number). Adding additional invalid characters results in reducing the number of digits that can be used to randomize the data that is being tokenized.

a| * Credit card number
* Decimal
* Social security number

|*Luhn digit test* 
a|This option is for the Credit card number data domain only. Use the Luhn checksum formula to validate the digits contained in the original data. The options are: +

* *Disabled*
* *Generated token must pass Luhn test*
* *Generated token must fail Luhn test*

|Credit card number

|*Maximum token length* 
|Enter a value for the maximum number of digits for the generated token.
a| * Decimal
* Lax decimal
* Email address
* Lax alphanumeric
* Printable ASCII
* Lax uppercase/lowercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax uppercase/decimal - Preserving
* Lax lowercase/decimal - Preserving


|*Preserve serial number sub-component* 
|This option is for the social security data domain only.
