ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]


== Prerequisites

* Verify that you have the `Write secrets` permission enabled. 
* Verify that you are in the correct environment using the environment switcher at the top of the left navigation bar.

== Create a Secret Group

. In Anypoint Platform, go to Management Center and select *Secrets Manager*.
. Click *Create Secret Group*.
. Type a name for the secret group and click *Save*.
+
The name of your secret group must: 
+
* Be at least three characters long and no longer than 35 characters
* Start with a letter
* Contain only letters, numbers, and dashes (but cannot end with a dash)

The secret group appears in the *Secret Groups* list view. Click *Edit* to add the necessary secret types, for example, a keystore or a truststore. 

[[add_certificate]]
== Add a Certificate

Add a single PEM or JKS certificate to the secret group. This certificate is the "leaf" certificate (end-entity certificate). Intermediary and root certificates are entered in the CA path when you <<add_keystore,add a keystore>>.  

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to which to add a certificate. 
. Select *Certificate* in the menu on the left, and click *Add Certificate*. 
. In the *Add Certificate* screen, add the required information. 
+
* *Name* - Enter a name for your certificate.
* *Type* -  Select the certificate type from the drop-down menu.
+
Supported types are:
+
** PEM
** JKS
* *Certificate File* -  Click *Choose File*, and select the certificate file to upload.
+
If you are uploading a JKS certificate, you also need to provide the passphrase for this certificate and select its alias from the drop-down menu.
. Click *Save*.

== Add a Truststore

Add a truststore for public certificates of trusted servers. The truststore is used to store certificates from the CA, which are then used to verify certificates presented by the server in an SSL connection. 

[NOTE]
You can add a maximum of 15 certificates to the truststore.

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to receive a new truststore. 
. Select *Truststore* in the menu on the left, and click *Add Truststore*. 
. In the *Add Truststore* screen, add the required information. 
+
* *Name* - Enter a name for your keystore.
* *Type* - Select the truststore type from the drop-down menu. +
Supported types are:
+
** PEM
** JKS
** PKCS12
** JCEKS
* *Truststore File* - Click *Choose File*, and select the truststore file to upload. 
* *Override Expiration Date* (Optional) - Select the date to override the default expiration date of the certificate. +
[NOTE]
If you are uploading a JKS, PKCS12, or JCEKS truststore file, you must also provide the passphrase for this truststore.
. Click *Save*.

[[add_keystore]]
== Add a Keystore

Specify the type of keystore to add to the secret group. The keystore is the combination of the authorization certificate, its corresponding private keys, and the certification authority's path.

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to which to add a keystore. 
. Select *Keystore* in the menu on the left, and click *Add Keystore*. 
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your keystore.
. In the *Type* field, select the keystore type from the drop-down menu.
+
Supported types include the following:
+
* Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) - Base64 encoded ASCII file with a `cer`, `crt`, or `pem` extension.
* Java Keystore (JKS) - Repository for authorization or public key certificates. The JKS keystore type does not store secret keys.
* PKCS12 - Stores server and intermediate certificates in an archive file format. The PKCS12 keystore type does not store secret keys.
* Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore (JCEKS) - Stores server and intermediate certificates as well as secret keys.
.. To add a *PEM* type keystore, you must provide the following: 
+
** *Certificate File* - Click *Choose File* to locate and upload the PEM certificate file.  
** *Key File* - Click *Choose File* to locate and upload the PEM formatted file that contains the private key for the certificate. 
** *Key Passphrase* - Enter the word or phrase that protects the private key. 
** *CA Path Certificate File* (Optional) - Click *Choose File* to locate and upload the certificate signed by a certification authority (CA). +
The CA path contains the other certificates that are related to the single <<add_certificate,certificate file>> that you added.   
** *Override Expiration Date* (Optional) - Select the date to override the default expiration date of the certificate.
.. To add a *JKS*, *PKCS12*, or *JCEKS* type keystore, you must provide the following:

. In the *Certificate Pinset* screen, add the required information. +
* *Name* - Enter a name for the certificate pinset. 
* *Certificate File* - Click *Choose File* and select the PEM formatted CA certificate to upload.

== Add a List of Revoked Certificates 

Add a list of certificates that were revoked by certificate authorities before their expiration dates. The server administrator (owner of Edge) may specify a CRL list and other algorithms to retrieve this list, or the server owner may point to an external public key infrastructure (PKI) or another vendor that maintains a list of revoked certificates. 

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to which to add a Certificate List Distributor (CRL) configuration. 
. In the menu on the left side, select *CRL Distributor Config*, and click *Add CRL*. 
. In the *Add Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Distributor Config* screen, add the required information.
+
* *Name* - Enter a name for your CRL distribution point.

. Click *Save*.

== Add a TLS Context

To encrypt inbound traffic to Runtime Fabric or Mule 4 proxies, add a certificate-key pair to a TLS context and then enable the TLS context. 

The TLS context you store in Secrets Manager can be used either when you configure an HTTPS API Proxy, or to validate the SSL handshake in the edge endpoint of Runtime Fabric.

. In the *Secret Groups* list view, select the secret group to which to add a TLS context. 
. Select *TLS Context* in the menu on the left, and click *Add TLS Context*. 
. In the *Create TLS Context* screen, add the required information.
+
* *Name* - Enter a name for your TLS context. 
* *TLS Version* - Select the TLS version. 
* *Target* - Select the target for the TLS context from the drop-down list. +
** *Anypoint Security* - Validates the SSL handshake for Runtime Fabric. +
If you use the *Anypoint Security* target, you can select keystores and truststores that are either PEM or non-PEM types. Supported types include: +
*** JKS
*** PKCS12
*** JCEKS 
** *Mule* - Uses the TLS context as the SSL validation for Mule 4 based API proxies. 
* *Keystore* - Select the keystore to store the TLS context in from the drop-down list.
* *Truststore* (Optional) - Select a truststore to add the TLS context to from the drop-down list.
* *Expiration Date* (Optional) - Select the expiration date for the certificate.
* *Enable Client Authentication* - Select this option to enable client authentication. 
+
Secrets Manager also allows you to select custom ciphers.
+

* DHE RSA AES128 GCM SHA256
* DHE RSA AES256 SHA256
* DHE RSA AES128 SHA256
* DHE RSA AES256 SHA
* DHE RSA AES128 SHA
* ECDHE RSA AES256 GCM SHA384
* ECDHE RSA AES128 GCM SHA256
* ECDHE RSA AES256 SHA384
* ECDHE RSA AES128 SHA256
* ECDHE RSA AES256 SHA
* ECDHE RSA AES128 SHA

. Click *Save*.

== Edit a Secret Group

When you edit a secret group, other users are locked out while you edit the necessary security objects.

. In Secrets Manager, click *Edit* for the secret group to update. 
. Make your changes, and click *Finish*. +
The secret group is updated with the changes, and Secrets Manager will serve the updated secrets to all redeployed applications after this point. 
. Click *Cancel Edit* to cancel an open edit session. +
You can use this to cancel another user's editing session. For example, if a user leaves an edit session open (without clicking *Finish*), other users can't open an edit session, and the *Edit* button is disabled. If the user who left the edit session open isn't available to close it, you can click *Cancel Edit* to cancel that user's edit session. +
This makes the *Edit* button available so you can make updates to the secret group. +
[NOTE]
If you cancel a user's edit, it deletes all that user's changes.
